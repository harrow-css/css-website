## Abstract

> The competitive programming thread aims to offer a 10-week, rigorous introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms, similar in level to an introductory undergraduate course. The ultimate aim of the thread is to better prepare attendees (and threads!) for the British Informatics Olympiad and CS interview questions at universities.

## Targets

### Deliverable Goals

- Get 3 Harrovians to score above 50 in BIO

### Technical Goals

**Search Algorithms**
- Binary Search
- Recursion
- Bitmask 

**Graph Algorithms**
- Breadth-First Search
- Depth-First Search
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm

**Thinking Computationally**
- Data Structures
- Dynamic Programming
- Amortized Analysis

## Session Structure

Each session is motivated by one CP problem and subsequently covers requisite theoretical concepts. A complete solution is left as an extension exercise, although approaches and opinions will be discussed during the thread. A list of extension readings will be provided.
