## Abstract

> The AI Thread takes a joint practical and theoretical approach to cover modern techniques of deep learning. It aims to get participants ready to develop their own AI projects!

## Targets

### Deliverable Goals

- You build a facial recognition AI
- You build a Shakepseare-writing AI
- You develop your own AI project with PyTorch

### Technical Goals

**Deep Learning**
- Neural networks
    - Perceptron
    - Activation functions
- Optimisation
    - Loss functions
    - Gradient-based optimisers
- Architectures
    - Convolutional neural networks
    - Transformers

**PyTorch**

- `torch.nn`
- `torch.autograd`
- `torch.utils.data`
- `torch.optim`

## Session Structure

Each session introduces a theoretical concept, usually followed by a practical demonstration that requires attendees to complete some code.

## Thread Syllabus

### Week 1: Introduction
- What is deep learning?
- Basic components of any deep learning project:
    - Data (with pre-processing)
    - Model
    - Optmisation (loss function + gradient descent)
    - Evaluation
- Decide what do you want to learn!
- `Extension`: Useful resources

### Week 2: Feedforward Neural Networks
- Perceptron
